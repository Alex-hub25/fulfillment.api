# fulfillment.api
This project is centered around a fulfillment api and database system inteded for the use in small to medium size e-commerce business's.
While a user weighs a package preparing for shipment an OCR triggered by a I.R. integrated camera reads the package dimensions and
packing slip data. Package data is transfered to database for storage and company record usage, simultaneously data is sent to multiple 
pre-approved freight carriers. A carrier service that meets pre-configured requirments is selected/purchased,
pickup is scheduled, carrier data is sent to database, shipping label is sent to printer.
